                <img src="./images/abyan-headshot.jpg" alt="picture of me (Abyan Osman)">
                <p>My name is Abyan Osman and I’m 20 years old. I was born and raised in <strong>Ottawa</strong>, but I’m originally from <em>Somalia</em>. </p>
                <p>Some of my favourite things to do are: watch tv and movies and hanging out with my friends and family. 
                I also got into reading at the end of 2021. I went through a bunch of genres and different types of books, but I would say my favourite genres are thriller, slice of life and cozy fantasies. My favourite kind of books to read are graphic novels, specifically mangas. 
                </p>
                <p>I first became interested in coding after I took a workshop. I decided then that I was interested in pursuing a career programming, so after I graduated from  while I graduated high school in 2020, I enrolled in Computer Engineering Technology but I quickly realized it wasn't for me. I then moved to Mobile App Development because 
                I wanted a program with more design and I was in it for 3 semesters. During my semester off I took some time to reflect and I realized that I was more passionate for design than programming. I decided that life was short I want so I left the program and enrolled in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. </p>
                <blockquote>"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people's thinking." <cite> -Steve Jobs</cite> </blockquote>
                <p>This quote really inspires me because I always wanted to please my parents and do something that would make them feel secure in my future. I later realized that life is short and I need to do what makes me happy and not live to impress others.</p>
